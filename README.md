# Introduction
This lab project is my audition to create virtual labs for pluralsight. It focuses on teaching students three main concepts: 
1) How to locate files and hidden files in the linux file system
2) The concept of encoded messages and how to decode base64 encoded messages
3) The concept of privilege escalation and a simple technique that can be used to bypass access restrictions.


# Some Environment Setup Notes
If you're attempting to duplicate this in your local environment, you'll need one Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop that runs the [Lab Setup Script](./Lab_setup.sh). 

# Learner Instructions

You will need to follow along in the [Lab Instructions](./Lab%20Instructions.md) we've provided in this repo. They should be run from the **Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop** machine you have set up.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
